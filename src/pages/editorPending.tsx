  <Card.Body>Funny Cat Flush - Story Behind The Story
The truth is that a cat in Santa Clara California really did discover how to flush the toilet.  We know that the name of this cat is Gizmo and he belongs to Nick and Scarlet. Gismo was mesmerised by the toilet flush, and somehow discovered for himself how to operate the lever. Scarlet discovered Gismo's habit by accident.  One afternoon Scarlet was as far as she knew, alone in the house.  Then the toilet flushed, seemingly of its own accord.  When Scarlet discreetly investigated she discovered that it was Gismo who was discharging the cistern.   Knowing that few would believe him, he taped a segment of the 'problem' for posterity.

  <Card.Body>"My dog, Timbit, and I were at the dog park one day. All the dogs were playing and having a good time. All of a sudden I saw a woman pick up Timbit and start walking away with him. I called to her and she didn't turn around so I freaked out that she was trying to steal him. I ran up to her, snatched Timbit away and started yelling at the woman. Then I realized that Timbit was standing at my feet and I had just grabbed a stranger's dog away from her. The dog wasn't even wearing the same colour harness. The whole entire park full of people were staring as I stammered out a few dozen apologies."

"We were sitting around the campfire while my dog napped on his blanket inside our tent. Some time later we heard lots of laughing, giggling, and even snorting. I looked around to see a giant silhouette of my dog, cast by the light of our campfire, as he enthusiastically 'romanced' a pillow."
"My dog picked up a funny habit of standing up like a person when he wants to see something better. My whole family thinks this is hilarious, but it turns out that not everyone does. We were out hiking in the woods one day and Koda stood up when he spotted someone approaching in the distance. I saw the person take note of Koda. Instead of laughing like I expected her to, she stopped in her tracks and pulled out her bear spray! Koda is a 100-lb, black Newfie-mix. It hadn't occurred to me that maybe Koda's cute little habit wasn't so cute when hiking in bear country! All ended well, thankfully."

"I had my family over to dinner to show them how grown-up I was and that I had learned to cook. We were having appetizers in front of the TV when my youngest sister started screaming hysterically. My hamster had escaped from her cage (again), and had gorged herself on some of the food and was fast asleep on the platter."
"I was out on a walk in a busy park with my dog, Kuma. I tie his leash around my waist to leave my hands free. This has always worked well because Kuma is usually very gentle and well-behaved. Unfortunately, I had never before seen what happens when he spots a squirrel: he took an enormous leap towards the squirrel, toppling me like a tree onto my face, and then dragged me for several yards until I could put on the brakes. Everyone saw."
